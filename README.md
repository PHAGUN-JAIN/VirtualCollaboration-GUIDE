# VirtualCollaboration-GUIDE

### Wiki's Defination

**Virtual collaboration** is the method of collaboration between members that is carried out via technology-mediated communication. Virtual collaboration follows the same process as collaboration, but the parties involved in virtual collaboration do not physically interact and communicate exclusively through technological channels.
