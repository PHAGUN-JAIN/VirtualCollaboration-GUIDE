## DISCORD
<br/>

discord is one of the best apps available out there, it provides variety of features like: voice calls,video calls, messaging, seprating virtual workspaces, and many more
<br/>
discord is availabe on mac, windows, iphone, android and guess what linux also, plus it can be used as web app too!

### How it works?

discord works on concept of servers, once you create your account you can either join server created by your team, or create your own, there are a lot of community servers available to join.

In a server one can create different roles for members of the server, the role can be created by the admin of the server, and based on those roles admin can restrict what members can do like
admin can restrict the permission for certain text-channel to read only for some roles and disable invite, etc

also custom emojis can be added to the server for fun :) 

recently a new feature called **Stages** is introduced there the stage moderators are allowed to speak and other members join as listeners basically its like clubhouse/twitterspaces

### Use case

there is no specified use case of discord, since it was first created for gamers to communicate while playing but it grew into somethiny far beyond that,
one can use it for hangout with friends, source of information, or a collaboration tool, all all in all it is a complete package!
